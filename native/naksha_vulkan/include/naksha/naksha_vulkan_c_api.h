/*
 * naksha_vulkan_c_api.h
 *
 * Narrow extern "C" ABI for the naksha::vulkan engine, built as a shared
 * library (naksha_vulkan.dll) so it can be driven from Python via ctypes
 * without pybind11 (none is available on this machine).
 *
 * Design rules (per integration task boundaries):
 *  - No Vulkan handle types cross this boundary (opaque uint64 handle only).
 *  - One process-wide renderer instance is enough for this phase (the app
 *    has a single main viewport); the API is still handle-shaped so a
 *    second instance could be added later without an ABI break.
 *  - Every function is safe to call in "not initialized" / "already failed"
 *    states and returns a bool/int status rather than throwing or crashing
 *    - this DLL must never be able to take the Python process down.
 *  - Point/surface uploads are bulk-only (one call per attribute), matching
 *    the existing PointCloudRenderer/SurfaceRenderer contracts (see
 *    include/naksha/PointCloudRenderer.hpp, SurfaceRenderer.hpp).

 * spend, and it was being told "GPU unknown / 1.00 GB / software-fallback" on a
 * machine where the engine had already opened an NVIDIA T400 with 4 GB. The
 * planner then either under-budgeted the whole cloud or probed the system a
 * second time and disagreed with itself. There is exactly ONE source of truth:
 * the device this handle is running on.
 *
 * nkv_get_vram_bytes        - largest DEVICE_LOCAL heap (real card memory)
 * nkv_get_device_vram_budget - the safe spendable figure: one 70% rule shared
 *                              with the surface budget, kept as a safety margin
 *                              so streaming never drives the card into an OOM or
 *                              a system-memory spill.
 *
 * Both return 0 when there is no device, which callers must treat as UNKNOWN -
 * never as "zero memory".
