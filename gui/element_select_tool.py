"""
ElementSelectTool — MicroStation-style element selection on top of
DigitizeManager + SelectionManager.

Pick methods:
  individual : click an element; hover preview before commit
  block      : drag a rectangle; enclosed elements
  shape      : click polygon vertices, right-click to close; enclosed
  cline      : click two points; elements crossed by that segment
  snt_text   : drag a rectangle; select only SNT labels for clipboard copy

Selection modes (taken from Qt keyboard modifiers each click):
  plain         -> NEW
  Ctrl          -> ADD
  Shift         -> SUBTRACT
  Ctrl+Shift    -> INVERT

The tool installs its own VTK observers and removes them on deactivate;
it never edits or replaces existing DigitizeManager observers. Activating
this tool calls DigitizeManager.set_tool(None) first so no draw tool is
listening to clicks at the same time.
