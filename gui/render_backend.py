"""render_backend.py - render backend seam, now wired into app_window.py.

STATUS: VtkRenderBackend (a thin call-through to the existing production VTK
code) is the default/only active backend. VulkanRenderBackend is a real
ctypes bridge to native/naksha_vulkan/build/naksha_vulkan.dll, but it is
opt-in only - selected via AppRenderBackendOwner below, which defaults to
"vtk" unless the NAKSHA_RENDER_BACKEND=vulkan environment variable is set,
and always falls back to "vtk" silently (logged, never raised) if Vulkan
probing/initialization fails for any reason. A failure in this module must
never prevent app_window.py / main.py from starting.

class VulkanRenderBackend(RenderBackend):
    """ctypes bridge to the native C ABI in native/naksha_vulkan.

    Implements the narrow extern "C" surface declared in
    include/naksha/naksha_vulkan_c_api.h (nkv_is_available,
    nkv_create_renderer, nkv_set_point_cloud, nkv_set_surface,
    nkv_set_display_mode, nkv_set_shading_parameters, nkv_set_camera_lookat,
    nkv_resize, nkv_render, nkv_clear, nkv_destroy_renderer). No Vulkan
    handle type crosses this boundary - only an opaque uint64 handle and
    raw numpy pointers.

    Known-incomplete pieces (see CHECKPOINTS.md / integration report, do not
    assume otherwise from this docstring alone):
      - set_display_mode/set_shading_parameters are accepted by the ABI but
        the fragment shaders do not yet branch on them (point.frag always
        reads the uploaded RGBA8 buffer; formulas (A)/(B) are not ported to
        GLSL). Surface/Shaded-Class colors are pre-baked on the CPU side and
        passed through (NKV_SHADE_PASSTHROUGH).
      - intensity-mode point coloring has no native buffer/shader path yet.
      - capture_frame() has no offscreen readback implemented natively.

        pinned to that geometry on every resize/move - all within
        self.frame, never touching the ribbon, menu bar, toolbars, docks or
        status bar, which are separate widgets elsewhere in the QMainWindow's
        tree. The widget's parent never changes here, so its native HWND
        (and therefore its live Vulkan surface) is never destroyed/recreated
        - only the swapchain extent is resized to match.

        This is the default path taken by gui/app_window.py (replacing the
        NAKSHA_VULKAN_PREVIEW split preview). Opt out with
        NAKSHA_VULKAN_PREVIEW=0|off|no or NAKSHA_RENDER_BACKEND=vtk.

        VTK itself is never hidden: only its LiDAR actors (point cloud /
        surface / shaded-class mesh) are switched off via
        set_vtk_lidar_rendering(False), so every overlay (SNT, digitizer,
        grid labels, measurements, text, vectors) keeps rendering - Vulkan's
        opaque surface simply sits on top of where the point cloud would
        have been drawn. Returns True when Vulkan is the visible viewport."""
