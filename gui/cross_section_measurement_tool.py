Cross-Section Measurement Tool for NakshaAI
--------------------------------------------
Lets the user measure distances by clicking two points directly inside a
cross-section (side) view. Each finished segment:

  1. Is drawn permanently inside that cross-section view (line + label), and
  2. Is mirrored into the main 3D view as a small VALUE-ONLY label (no line —
     a cross-section measurement is a vertical/profile distance, and drawing
     its two endpoints as a full 3D line across a top-down main view is
     misleading), using the true world-space coordinates recovered from the
     cross-section's own local (along, across, elevation) frame.

Independence / safety notes:
  - This tool owns its own VTK observers and is only ever attached to the
    cross-section VTK widgets it is explicitly activated for. It is inert
    (no observers, no behavior change) until `activate()` is called.
  - It never touches `measurement_tools.MeasurementTool`'s interactive state
    (mode, measurement_points, undo/redo stacks, snap cache, etc.). The only
    thing it calls on that tool is the additive
    `MeasurementTool.add_cross_section_measurement()` helper, which appends a
    finished measurement using the same rendering building blocks the main
    tool already uses for its own finalized measurements.
  - It never touches `SectionController`'s drawing/locate logic. While a
    measurement is being taken in a given section view, this tool simply
    consumes (aborts) the click so the section-drawing observer does not
    also react to it in that view — the same precedence pattern the main
    measurement tool already uses against cross-section drawing elsewhere.

Performance notes (why the first version glitched/lagged):
  - Mouse-move no longer runs an expensive cell-pick every event; it only
    ever projects the cursor onto the pending point's local plane (cheap
    display->world math), and is time-throttled. Picking (which walks
    render-pass geometry) only happens twice per segment, at the two clicks.
  - The rubber-band preview reuses one actor/polydata per view and mutates
    its points in place instead of allocating a new mapper/actor every
    mouse-move — this was the main source of stutter.
  - The click-time picker is restricted (PickList) to that view's own
    point-cloud actor when it can be found, so it can never accidentally
    pick a grid label, a DXF/SNT overlay, or one of this tool's own
    previously drawn lines/labels — the main source of "measurement is
    incorrect" / stray lines in earlier testing.
