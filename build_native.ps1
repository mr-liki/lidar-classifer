# build_native.ps1 - rebuild the native Vulkan renderer exactly the way the app
# loads it: gui/render_backend.py's _DLL_CANDIDATES prefers
# native/naksha_vulkan/build_msvc/naksha_vulkan.dll, and
# naksha_vulkan_c_api.cpp sets RendererConfig::shaderDirectory to the DLL's own
# directory, so the matching surface/point .spv files must land there too (the
# CMake POST_BUILD copy step already does that).
#
# Why a script: the build_msvc tree is a Ninja + MSVC-tree build, so cl.exe needs
# the Visual Studio developer environment (INCLUDE/LIB/PATH) that cmake only
# captures at configure time. Calling vcvars64.bat and cmake in one cmd.exe
# invocation is the only reliable way to rebuild without a full VS shell.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_native.ps1
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_native.ps1 -BuildDir build
#
# Only the naksha_vulkan target is built by default: the sibling
# naksha_vulkan_benchmark target has no main() in tests/benchmark_main.cpp and
# fails to link, which would abort a whole-tree build before the DLL is
# relinked. Pass -Target to build something else.
